## [Unreleased]

### In Progress
- Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) — replacing custom correction heuristic with proper
  quasi-probability implementation via Mitiq

### Recently Completed
- ZNE upgraded to circuit folding — gate-level noise amplification via G G† G repetition
- Richardson extrapolation added alongside linear — both methods run and compared on every ZNE experiment
- Fixed duplicate `plt.show()` in `zne_plotter.py`
- PEC replaced with proper quasi-probability implementation — builds QPR of depolarizing channel,
  computes gamma (sampling overhead), applies analytical inverse-noise correction
- All plotting utilities fully relabelled — histograms, ZNE plot, and circuit diagrams now have
  descriptive titles, axis labels, value annotations, colour coding, and footer explanations
  readable by a lay audience

### Planned (Phase II completion)
- Clifford Data Regression (CDR) via Mitiq
- Metrics module: fidelity, expectation value accuracy, error reduction %, sampling overhead
- Fix: remove duplicate `plt.show()` in `zne_plotter.py`
- Unit tests for all mitigation functions

### Planned (Phase III & IV)
- QFT, VQE, QAOA benchmark circuits
- Automated benchmarking suite across noise levels and circuit depths
- Performance comparison table (ZNE vs PEC vs MEM vs CDR)
- Dynamical Decoupling
- Virtual Distillation
- Visualization dashboard

## [0.4.0] — 2025-07

### Added
- Code audit completed — full review of all Phase I and Phase II implementation against
  project specification; issues identified and documented in Phase II completion checklist
- README updated — project status table, Phase II checklist, technologies table updated
- CHANGELOG updated to reflect current state and remaining work

### Notes
- PEC custom correction scheme confirmed as a heuristic approximation, not true
  quasi-probability PEC; replacement with Mitiq PEC is the next priority
- ZNE circuit uses error-probability scaling rather than circuit folding; upgrade planned

## [0.3.1] — 2025

### Notes
- Python environment confirmed stable under 3.12.13
- All five experiments (`bell`, `ghz`, `mem`, `zne`, `pec`) verified end-to-end
- Result figures saved to `results/figures/ideal/`, `noisy/`, and `mitigated/`

---

## [0.3.0] — 2025

### Added
- **Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC)** — custom correction-factor implementation
  in `src/mitigation/probabilistic_error_cancellation.py`
- PEC demo entry point `src/mitigation/pec.py` wired into `run.py` as `python run.py pec`
- `run.py` unified experiment launcher — all experiments runnable via a single CLI entry point
- `EXPERIMENTS` registry mapping short names to experiment `main()` functions

### Changed
- All `experiments/noise_demos/` scripts refactored to expose a `main()` function
- `src/mitigation/mem_demo.py` and `src/mitigation/zne.py` likewise refactored to expose `main()`

---

## [0.2.0] — 2025

### Added
- **Measurement Error Mitigation (MEM)** — full implementation using 4×4 calibration matrix
  and matrix inversion
  - `src/mitigation/calibration.py` — calibration circuit builder for all 4 two-qubit basis states
  - `src/mitigation/measurement_error_mitigation.py` — `build_calibration_matrix` and
    `mitigate_counts`
  - `src/mitigation/mem_demo.py` — end-to-end MEM demo on Bell state with readout noise
- **Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE)** — linear extrapolation across noise scaling factors 1×, 2×, 3×
  - `src/mitigation/zero_noise_extrapolation.py` — `linear_extrapolation` and
    `calculate_expectation_value`
  - `src/mitigation/zne.py` — end-to-end ZNE demo on Bell state with depolarizing noise
- **ZNE plotter** — `src/plotting/zne_plotter.py` saves extrapolation graph to
  `results/figures/mitigated/`
- Results saved to structured `results/figures/` subdirectories: `ideal/`, `noisy/`, `mitigated/`
